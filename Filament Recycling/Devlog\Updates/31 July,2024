So far, I have some of the 3D models for the winding mechanism in a rough beta phase. The files should be viewable/downloadable in the model files directory.

The motor-spool axel adapter's opening for the motor's axel is too tight as is, and I will update that before the next version.
The spool itself is not large enough (I shrunk it down to save on printing time) and realized that the filament would warp if I tried to wrap it around that spool.
